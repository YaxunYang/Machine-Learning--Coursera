## My Solution of Assignments of Machine-Learning on Coursera
This is my solution to the assignments of Machine-Learning on Coursera.
[Machine-Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) is
a classical class, whose advisor is Andrew Ng. When you finish this class, 
you'll know how to select the right algorithm for the specifical machine learning tasks, 
as well as become an expert at 'debugging' and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.
And there are also many interesting machine learning problems shown is the course: anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, etc.

**Note:** If you consult my source codes that you may want to incorporate into your algorithm or system, you should clearly cite references in your codes.

**BTW:** I have got Grade Achieved: 99.6% in this course. This is the snapshot of my [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/5ZRHYV6JF6AN)
